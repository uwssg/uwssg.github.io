The Survey Science Group (SSG) at the University of Washington is
comprised of a group of astrophysicists with a broad range of survey
science experience and <a href="research.shtml">research</a>
interests. Our current group consists of four faculty, five postdocs,
nine graduate students and twelve undergraduate students.  We work on
Near Earth Objects, Supernovae, Large Scale Structure, Cosmology ,
Galactic Structure, and Variables and Transients.  One of our primary
focuses is the scientific development of the <a
href="http://www.lsst.org">Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</a>
as well as developing simulations, and <a href="http://db.cs.washington.edu/astrodb/">data management software</a>
for analyzing the data expected from this digital map of the sky.  For
tools and information related to simulations and science expected from
LSST check out the <a href="lsst.shtml">UW LSST</a> pages.  With
data volumes exceeding six Petabytes per year there are many exciting
<a href="escience.shtml">scientific</a> challenges
that we will need to address over the coming years.
