<a name="googlesky"></a><h2>Google Sky</h2>
<p>

In 2006 <a href="people.shtml?people/sk">Simon Krughoff</a> and <a
href="people.shtml?people/ajc">Andy Connolly</a> worked with Google on
creating <a href="http://earth.google.com/"> Google Sky </a> (aka Sky
in Google Earth). Sky provides seamless access to astronomical images
taken from a wide range of telescopes (from the Hubble Space Telescope
to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Digitized Sky Surveys). It
enables users to pan and zoom around the sky, find interesting
astronomical objects and customize your own view of the universe. Sky
was released in August 2007 and within the first few days had been
tried by millions of users. At UW we maintain an interest in using
these visualization tools in research and education. A range of
add-ons that have been created at UW for Google Sky can be found <a
href="http://sky.astro.washington.edu/"> here </a> or you can check
out the movie that combines the image simulations for LSST with Google
Sky.

<p>

How we work with the next generation of astronomical data sets that
can be distributed across the globe is an area of great interest to
our group. We have generated a number of tools for using webservices
to analyze data such as an automated detection and cross matching
service for images <a href="http://nvogre.phyast.pitt.edu:8080/wsext">
WESIX </a>. <a href="people.shtml?people/sk">Simon Krughoff</a> has
been a regular faculty member at the National Virtual Observatoty
(NVO) Summer Schools. Links to some useful presentations from the
summer schools can be found below.
