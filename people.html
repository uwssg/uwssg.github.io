<h3>Can't Find Someone?</h3>
<br>

Not everyone in UW Astronomy is involved in Survey Science and Design. If 
you can't find the person you are looking for, try the Astronomy 
Department's <a href="http://astro.washington.edu/research.html">Faculty 
Research</a> pages.

The Survey Science Group at UW is currently comprised of four faculty, 
five post-docs, and a large number of graduate and undergraduate students.  The 
sidebar links take you to each faculty and postdoc's SSG site where you'll find 
descriptions of their research interests and their involvment in survey 
science and outreach at the UW.

<p>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has imaged the same patches of sky
multiple times to search for supernovae. These images are also very
useful to detect inner solar system objects: since they are so close
to us and moving, they appear in different locations in each
image. The red, green, and blue tracks in this image show the motion
of an asteroid. Image courtesy the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Pre-MAP
students Amy, Amber, Kenza, Katryn and A.J. used the SDSS Supernova
Survey difference imaging database to search for inner solar system
objects. They examined objects automatically and manually to classify
them as moving objects. Their research plan had three primary goals :
search for comets in the data; accurately measure the colors and
extend the orbits of known asteroids in the data; and extend the
orbital completeness by nearly 2 magnitudes by "linking" multiple
instances of unknown objects into new orbits.
