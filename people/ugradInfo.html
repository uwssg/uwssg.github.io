<p>
Mentor: Andrew Connolly<br>
Research Description: Ian and Conor are developing new ways to interact with astro data within the browser. Our approach utilizes a wide range of freely available APIs and social technologies in a widget-based environment. Our method aims to speed access to data as well as aid in scientific collaboration and public outreach.

<a name="ule"></a><h2>Nicholas Ule</h2>      
<p>
Mentor: Nicole Silvestri<br>
Research Description: Nick has been reducing APO DIS red/blue spectra of SDSS WDMs to determine the 
orbital periods of these systems.  The M dwarfs in these 
systems are particularly active which may indicate that the binary is quite close (short period) and 
possibly on its way to becoming a CV.  Nick has used the time-series spectra to determine their radial 
velocities and orbital periods and has compiled other system properties (age, mass, spectral type, colors, 
etc) from previous work in the hopes of producing a description of these systems' evolution toward the CV 
phase.  We are currently working on a paper for publication by the fall, before Nick heads off to graduate 
school at NMSU.

<a name="wold"></a><h2>Brian Wold</h2>      
<p>
Mentor: Lynne Jones<br>
Research Description:
Brian has been working to photometrically calibrate CFHT data Lynne acquired in 2004, nearly simultaneous to
the Spitzer FLS-EPS survey's observations of asteroids in multiple near-IR bands. With the photometrically 
calibrated visual data (g and r bands), and the near IR measurements of the same known asteroids, we are calculating 
albedos using different thermal models. Brian presented this work at the Undergraduate Research Symposium in spring 09, and is 
headed off to Germany in the fall of 2009 for a year studying abroad as a Geissen Scholar.
