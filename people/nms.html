<a name="about"></a><h2>About Me</h2>
<p>

I am an observational astronomer specializing in the evolution of binary systems, primarily those 
comrised of a low mass star and a white dwarf.  I arrived at UW for my first post-doc position in 
January 2003 to work with <a href="http://astro.washington.edu/users/slh/">Dr. Suzanne Hawley</a>, 
after completing my dissertation work at the <a href="http://www.fit.edu">Florida Institute of 
Technology </a> under <a href="http://www.astro.fit.edu/oswalt/oswalt.html">Dr. Terry Oswalt</a>.  

</p>
<p>

My work focuses on the properties of M dwarf stars in close binary systems with white dwarf 
companions found spectroscopically in the <a href="http://www.sdss.org">Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey</a>.  This work was an extension of my dissertation work, which focused primarily on the 
properties of M dwarf stars, such as chromospheric activity and age, in wide, common proper motion 
binary (CPMB) systems with white dwarf companions, first discovered by W. Luyten (1963).  The 
publications resulting from this work can be found through the <a 
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/nms/publications.shtml">publications</a> link at the 
right.

</p>
<p>

In addition to my research, I work with SSG member <a href="acb.shtml">Andy Becker</a> and <a 
href="www.astro.washington.edu/users/rowen/">Russell Owen</a>, under the guidance of <a 
href="ajc.shtml">Dr. Andrew Connolly</a>, as part of the <a href="http://www.lsst.org">Large 
Synoptic Survey</a>'s <a href="dm.shtml">Data Management team</a> at UW.  My primary 
responsibilities involve the development and support of the software for the image processing 
pipelines for the LSST, UML and our SSG webpages.  You can read in more detail about UW's 
involvement in LSST on our <a href="home_lsst.shtml"> SSG LSST</a> links.

<a name="current"></a><h2>Current Research Interests</h2>

<p>
Below, I list the current research projects I have underway at the
University of Washington.  I give a brief description of each project
here, but you can read more about the details of these projects on our
Research Pages under <a

<li><h3>Close Binary M Dwarf-White Dwarf Systems</h3></li>

<p>

My current research the University of Washington involves the study of the evolution of dMs in 
close WD+dM binary systems, often referred to as pre-cataclysmic variables (pre-CVs), drawn from 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  The ultimate goal of this project is to fully understand how 
the close binary environment influences the evolution of the low mass secondary and to compare 
these results to a variety of recent low mass star studies in the literature (Reid et al. 1995, 
Hawley et al. 1996, West et al. 2004, to name a few) and to the evolution of low mass stars in 
wide binaries as discussed below.

<li><h3>Chromospheric Activity and Ages of M Dwarf stars</h3></li>

<p>

We obtain the effective temperatures and log(g) estimates of the separated WD spectra from the 
atmospheric models of D. Koester and rough ages from WD evolutionary models (Bergeron et al. 
1995).  We use the TiO bandhead ratios of the dMs to determine the spectral type (mass, Hawley et 
al. 1996), activity level (Halpha EW and L_Halpha/L_bol), and distance.  We measure the radial 
velocities and full space motions (U, V, W) of each system to determine the population membership 
of the sample.  We have approached the study of these systems from several avenues, the full 
results of which was presented at the 2005 SDSS Special Session of the January AAS meeting in San 
Diego and in (Lemagie et al. 2005, Silvestri et al. 2005b) and in two publications (Silvestri et 
al. 2005c,d). We have found some interesting and surprising results.  I highlight a few here:

<br>
<br>

<li><h3>Pre-CVs and the missing magnetic Pre-CV problem.</h3></li>

<p>

This is the most surprising outcome of the project.  While assessing our growing number of WD+dM 
pre-CV pairs we have discovered that <em>very few of the WDs in these pairs appear to be 
magnetic</em> (see Lemagie et al. 2005, Silvestri et al. 2005b).  Less than 10 out of over 600 
DA+dM pre-CVs fitted with magnetic hydrogen WD models were determined to have a magnetic field, 
and in all cases the field was small (< 10 MG).  It is intriguing that nearly 25% of all known 
CV systems harbor a magnetic WD with an appreciable magnetic field (~30-50 MG) and yet we see 
very few pre-CVs with magnetic WDs.

<li><h3>Common Proper Motion Binary M Dwarf-White Dwarf Systems</h3></li>

<p>

For my thesis work as a graduate student at Florida Tech we used common proper motion binary 
(CPMB) systems first identified by W. Luyten (1963) to study activity in low mass stars.  The goal 
was to develop a chromospheric activity-age relation for low mass M dwarfs (dMs; see Silvestri et 
al. 2001; Silvestri 2002; Silvestri et al. 2002, 2005a) similar to the one for F, G,and K dwarf 
stars (Skumanich 1972), though due in part to structural differences in the M dwarf sequence is 
significantly more complex than the current relation (F(Ca K) = At^-1/2).  We aimed to extend 
these relations to ages much larger than those determined by studies of dMs in open clusters (see 
Reid et al. 1995, Hawley et al. 1996, and references therein).
</p>

<li><h3>White Dwarf Star Ages and Kinematics</h3></li>

<p>

The wide binaries in this study are comprised of a white dwarf (WD) star and dM (WD+dM) with 
average separations of ~100's AU.  The binaries are coeval, therefore age of the WD, as 
determined from WD evolutionary models (Bergeron et al. 1995), is the age of the dM companion.  
Using a sample of approximately 200 WD+dM CPMBs we were able to confirm that dMs remain active for 
a longer time at later spectral type, a trend established in studies of dMs in clusters. We were 
also successful at extending these relations to ages much older than can be examined using dMs in 
open clusters.  Our study revealed a tremendous amount of complexity in assigning age based on 
activity alone (Silvestri et al. 2005a).
