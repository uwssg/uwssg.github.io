<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
My astronomy background lies in observational surveys for faint moving
objects -- in other words, I got my start in obtaining and analyzing
(including writing software for image analysis) observations from pencil-beam (aka "shift and
stack") surveys for Kuiper belt objects. These days I am also
interested in anything that moves or changes in the sky, having
expanded my interests to transient and variable objects in the night
sky. LSST will provide wonderful resources to search for all of these
objects, and I'm finding the technical challenges involved in querying
and classifying objects in large datasets fascinating. 

I joined the LSST project here at UW as the LSST Science Fellow (postdoc) in the fall of 2006. Previously I
was a postdoc at the University of British Columbia (and briefly at
the Herzburg Institute for Astronomy), working on the CFHT-LS Very
Wide with <a href="http://www.astro.ubc.ca/people/gladman/">Brett
Gladman</a>, <a href="http://salish.dao.nrc.ca/~kavelaar/">JJ
Kavelaars</a>, <a
href="http://www.obs-besancon.fr/publi/petit/petit.html">Jean-Marc Petit</a>
and <a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu/~joel/research.html">Joel
Parker</a>, among others, on the <a
href="http://www.cfeps.net/">CFEPS</a> project. Before that, I
was a graduate student in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University
of Michigan with advisor <a href="http://www.physics.upenn.edu/~garyb/">Gary
Bernstein</a>.  I became the LSST Performance Science (a research scientist position) here at UW in 2010.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p>
My thesis advisor taught me to look for the advances in science 
resulting from a project. My current advisor is teaching me that
there is a lot of cool science in many areas of astronomy. The project
I work with is showing me that there is a lot of very cool technology coming
round the corner. Together, this means my research interests are
getting broader, from a small bodies in the solar system background to
an interest in classification of transients and variables (as well as
those moving objects!).  In particular, I'm very interested in applying new computing technology and methods
to discovering and characterizing the small bodies in our solar system.

Current research projects: (sorry, this is a little out of date)
<ul> 
<li>Kuiper Belt Objects in SDSS</li>
<li>KBO populations as detected in <a href="http://www.cfeps.net">CFEPS</a></li>
<li>Other things</li>
With undergraduate <a href="people.shtml?people/ugradInfo#wold">Brian Wold</a>, calibrate CFHT
observations of known asteroids (in g and r) taken at the same time as
Spitzer near-IR observations and calculate albedoes. 
</ul>

<h2>LSST</h2>

<p>
I work on a variety of projects for LSST. Most of these have to do 
with evaluation of LSST's potential performance. A few of the thing I work on:
the <a href="http://opsimcvs.tuc.noao.edu/">Operations Simulation</a>
(mostly metric development and new cadence suggestions), the
Calibration Simulation (catalog generation, self-calibration procedures)
the <a href="http://lsst.astro.washington.edu/">Image Simulation</a>
(mostly catalog construction), the Moving Object Pipeline, 
<a href="http://www.lsstcorp.org/sciencewiki">Science Collaborations</a>,
and pretty much anything else that needs to be investigated or evaluated.

If you have a suggestion for an LSST science evaluation metric or
tool, please let me know. We'll see what we can do.
