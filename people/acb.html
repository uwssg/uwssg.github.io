<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>

My research interests in the past have focused on detecting and
following-up unusual microlensing events in real-time (with MACHO,
GMAN, and MPS). However, my pursuits have since broadened to the
generalized problem of detecting and classifying astronomical
variability regardless of type (with DLS, SDSS, and LSST). In
particular, if one wants to recognize rare classes of transient
events, the background of more prosaic astronomical variability must
first be recognized and removed. Modern surveys that simultaneously
survey faint, fast, and wide are now at a threshold where we expect
these new sorts of discoveries. Accomplishing this will require
advances in the integration of computing and information management
necessary to extract and model astronomical variability information in
real-time. Recent science pursuits include: mining survey data for
distant Trans-Neptunian Objects, phasing large time-series of 2MASS
data for periodic variability, pursuing a novel method to estimate
Supernova Type Ia distances and constrain cosmology, undertaking a
Principal Component Analysis of M-dwarf spectra, and writing reams of
software for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

At this stage, writing the pixel--level applications for the nightly image processing pipeline.  

<p>
</p>

<li><h3>SDSS Science</h3></li>
Constraining cosmology using Type I supernovae; mining the supernova data for asteroids and solar system objects; creating a database of period objects from this dataset.
<p>

<h2>Students and Research</h2>
<p>
Amy Rose (transit timing variations); AJ Singh and Kathryn Smith
(phase curves of asteroids).

<h2>Research, Diversity and Outreach</h2>
Active in the Department's Pre-MAP program.  Leading a 9-week NSF Faculty and Student Teams (FaST) program at the University, awarded as a subcontract through LSST Corporation.  We are working on modelling the transfer function of LSST for recovering periodic variability.
