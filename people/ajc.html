<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I arrived at UW in the summer of 2007 after spending some years on the
faculty of the University of Pittsburgh and before that at the Johns
Hopkins University. This must mean that I am not afraid of cloud as
both Pittsburgh and Seattle share the same number of clear days per
year (not many). I work principally on large astronomical surveys such
as the <a href="http://www.sdss.org">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> and
the <a href="http://www.lsst.org"> Large Synoptic Sky Survey</a>. I
currently run the UW data management group for LSST which works on
developing software analyzing the data that will come out of the LSST
and I also run the LSST image simulation group which is developing
high fidelity simulations of what we expect to see with LSST. My
science focuses on analyzing large astronomical data sets to study the
formation and evolution of galaxies and cosmology using techniques
such as photometric redshifts.

</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<ul class="disc">

<li><h3>Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST)</h3></li>
<p>
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will produce the largest digital
map of the sky. Imaging half the sky every three nights it will
produce over 20 TB of images each night and 1 Petabytes of catalog
data per year. My interests in LSST focus on weak lensing (in
particular mass tomography using photometric redshifts), algorithms
for analyzing this massive data stream and high fidelity simulations
(working with John Peterson and Garrett Jernigan). The <a
href="http://lsst.astro.washington.edu"> Image Simulation Group</a>
provides high fidelity end-to-end simulations of the sky. These
simulated images and catalogs extend to r=28 (deeper than the expected
10 year depth of the LSST coadded images) and are used in: designing
and testing algorithms for the use by the data management groups,
evaluating the capabilities and scalability of the reduction and
analysis pipelines, testing and optimizing the scientific returns of
the LSST survey and providing realistic LSST data to the science
collaborations to evaluate the expected performance of LSST.

</p>

<li><h3>Google Sky </h3></li>
<p>

In 2006 I was on sabbatical at Google where I was project lead for <a
href="http://earth.google.com">Google Sky</a> which puts astronomical
images taken from a wide range of telescopes (from the Hubble Space
Telescope to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Digitized Sky
Surveys). Sky was released in August 2007 and at UW we maintain an
interest in using these visualization tools in research and
education. A range of add-ons that have been created at UW for Google
Sky can be found <a href="">here</a> or you can check out the movie
that combines the image simulations for LSST with Google Sky.

</p>

<li><h3>Scalable Science</h3></li>
<p>
Cloud computing has revolutionized the way business is done on the
Internet. By linking hundreds to thousands of computers together with
Petabyte data storage, massively intensive (in both data and
computation) tasks can be addressed. Astronomy is facing many of these
issues with the next generation of surveys producing Petabytes of
catalogs and tens of Petabytes of images. We work on how to make
science easily scalable which represents a departure from traditional
thinking in the area of high performance computing in which the data,
CPUs, and memory all reside on the same physical machine with fast
communication between all components. Instead the processing units
only have access to a small amount of local storage and can be
considered to be isolated from the other compute nodes in the
cluster. Our <a
href="http://ssg.astro.washington.edu/research.shtml?CluE1">Cluster
Exploration (CluE) </a> initiative work is a joint effort between NSF,
Google, and IBM to develop tools for astronomy that can work on large
compute resources.
