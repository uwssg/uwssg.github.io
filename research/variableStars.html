<h2>Binary Stars</h2>

<ul class="disc">
<li><h3>Close Binary M Dwarf-White Dwarf Systems</h3></li>
<br>
<p>

This project, primarily carried out by SSG member <a
href="people.shtml?people/nms">Nicole Silvestri</a>, her UW
collaborators, and her <a
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/nms/students.shtml">undergraduate
students</a>, involves the study of the evolution of dMs in close
WD+dM binary systems, often referred to as pre-cataclysmic variables
(pre-CVs), drawn from the <a href="http://www.sdss.org">Sloan Digital
Sky Survey</a> (SDSS).  The ultimate goal of this project is to fully
understand how the close binary environment influences the evolution
of the low mass secondary and to compare these results to a variety of
recent low mass star studies in the literature (Reid et al. 1995,
Hawley et al. 1996, West et al. 2004, to name a few) and to the
evolution of low mass stars in wide binaries as discussed below.

</p>
<p>

As the progenitors to CVs, many of which eventually evolve to become
Type 1a supernovae (SNe), pre-CVs are integral in understanding some
of the more vexing questions associated with the current observed CV
population, such as magnetic CV progenitors and the "period gap". The
prolific use of Type 1a SNe for groundbreaking cosmology has also lead
to an increased interest in the pre-CV environment as we have yet to
fully understand the origin and nature of Type 1a progenitors. A
detailed study of pre-CV systems allows us to test widely used
theories on common envelope (CE) evolution and orbital angular
momentum loss (magnetic breaking).  Most of what we know about these
theories are generally inferred from the properties of the current CV
population, which is complicated by the significant effects of mass
transfer.

<p>

Our current sample of pre-CVs consists of over 1600 spectroscopically
identified pairs discovered in the SDSS (see Figure 1).  Raymond et
al. (2003) laid the groundwork for this project and showed that to
properly analyze the properties of both components of the pre-CV,
great care must be taken to effectively separate the WD flux from the
dM flux in the combined SDSS spectrum.  I have improved upon this
procedure with an iterative method involving the subsequent fitting
and subtraction of best fit SDSS template dM spectra (Hawley et
al. 2002) and model WD spectra of D.  Koester (see Kleinman et
al. 2004) from the combined DA+dM SDSS spectra in our sample (see
Silvestri et al. 2005b).

</p>

<li><h3>Pre-CVs and the missing magnetic Pre-CV problem.</h3></li>
<br>
<p>

This is the most surprising outcome of the projects carried out by SSG
member <a href="people.shtml?people/nms">Nicole Silvestri</a>, her UW
collaborators, and her <a
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/nms/students.shtml">undergraduate
students</a>.  While assessing our growing number of WD+dM pre-CV
pairs we have discovered that <em>very few of the WDs in these pairs
appear to be magnetic</em> (see Lemagie et al. 2005, Silvestri et
al. 2005b).  Less than 10 out of over 600 DA+dM pre-CVs fitted with
magnetic hydrogen WD models were determined to have a magnetic field,
and in all cases the field was small (< 10 MG).  It is intriguing that
nearly 25% of all known CV systems harbor a magnetic WD with an
appreciable magnetic field (~30-50 MG) and yet we see very few pre-CVs
with magnetic WDs.

</p>  
<p>

SDSS J121209.31+013627.7, discovered by Schmidt et al. (2003) may be
the first magnetic WD found to have a non-degenerate companion. We
have shown that the magnetic WD has a significant amount of emission
in both Halpha and Hbeta (Figure 4a,b) and a large velocity variation
indicating the existence of a close companion.  Magnetic WDs have been
shown to be more massive than their non-magnetic counterparts
(Liebert, Bergeron, & Holberg 2005), therefore we believe the
companion is most likely a low mass late M dwarf or a brown dwarf.  I
was granted three half nights on the Astrophysical Research
Consortium's 3.5-m telescope for radial velocity followup to determine
the orbital period.

<li><h3>White Dwarf Star Ages and Kinematics</h3></li>
<br>
<p>

This project, primarily carried out by SSG member <a
href="people.shtml?people/nms">Nicole Silvestri</a>, her UW
collaborators, and her <a
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/nms/students.shtml">undergraduate
students</a> uses the wide binaries from her thesis comprised of a
white dwarf (WD) star and dM (WD+dM) with average separations of
~100's AU.  The binaries are coeval, therefore age of the WD, as
determined from WD evolutionary models (Bergeron et al. 1995), is the
age of the dM companion.  Using a sample of approximately 200 WD+dM
CPMBs we were able to confirm that dMs remain active for a longer time
at later spectral type, a trend established in studies of dMs in
clusters. We were also successful at extending these relations to ages
much older than can be examined using dMs in open clusters.  Our study
revealed a tremendous amount of complexity in assigning age based on
activity alone (Silvestri et al. 2005a).

</p>
<p>

We also investigate the kinematics and space motion of the CPMB
populations and used this sample to address the dark matter content of
the halo.  We showed that the use of kinematics as the sole means for
identifying potential halo members can lead to erroneous estimates of
the number of halo WD. Using the variety of temperature and
metallicity sensitive features present in dM spectra, we demonstrated
that even though a large fraction of our CPMBs have halo-like
kinematics, only one of the dMs had a metallicity indicative of the
halo population (Silvestri et al. 2001).  The rest are likely members
of the high velocity tail of the thick disk component of the Galaxy.

<li><h3>Chromospheric Activity and Ages of M Dwarf stars</h3></li>

<p>

This project, primarily carried out by SSG member <a
href="people.shtml?people/nms">Nicole Silvestri</a>, her UW
collaborators, and her <a
href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/nms/students.shtml">undergraduate
students</a> aims to obtain the effective temperatures and log(g)
estimates of the separated WD spectra from the atmospheric models of
D. Koester and rough ages from WD evolutionary models (Bergeron et al.
1995).  We use the TiO bandhead ratios of the dMs to determine the
spectral type (mass, Hawley et al. 1996), activity level (Halpha EW
and L_Halpha/L_bol), and distance.  We measure the radial velocities
and full space motions (U, V, W) of each system to determine the
population membership of the sample.  We have approached the study of
these systems from several avenues, the full results of which was
presented at the 2005 SDSS Special Session of the January AAS meeting
in San Diego and in (Lemagie et al. 2005, Silvestri et al. 2005b) and
in two publications (Silvestri et al. 2005c,d). We have found some
interesting and surprising results.  I highlight a few here:

  and 2 sigma error ellipses for the disk and stellar halo
  population, respectively.</div>
</div>

<p> 

The current sample of pre-CV secondaries shows enhanced activity as
compared to a large sample of field dMs in the SDSS.  This is
interesting, though not terribly surprising, given the potential for
the close binary environment to increase the spin of the secondary due
to tidal interaction, thereby increasing the activity.  Nearly 31% of
early dMs and 84% of mid-dMs are active in this pre-CV sample as
compared to 2% and 34% in West et al. (2004), respectively.
Irradiation of the secondary by the hot WD companion is also a likely
contributer to the observed activity in these systems.

</p>
<p>

The orbital periods determined for a small subset of our sample show a
large range in periods.  The longest periods are 10's of hours. The
shortest are very close to the onset of mass transfer (~4 hours) and a
few periods fall within the CV "period gap" (2 < P_orb < 3
hours). This large range from long to short orbital periods can be
taken as snapshots in time of the orbital evolution of a given pre-CV
system - starting with the pair's emergence from the CE through the
onset of mass transfer, providing a unique look at the evolution of a
pre-CV system over time.

<li><h3>Common Proper Motion Binary M Dwarf-White Dwarf Systems</h3></li>
<br>
<p>

We use common proper motion binary (CPMB) systems first identified by
W. Luyten (1963) to study activity in low mass stars.  The goal was to
develop a chromospheric activity-age relation for low mass M dwarfs
(dMs; see Silvestri et al. 2001; Silvestri 2002; Silvestri et
al. 2002, 2005a) similar to the one for F, G,and K dwarf stars
(Skumanich 1972), though due in part to structural differences in the
M dwarf sequence is significantly more complex than the current
relation (F(Ca K) = At^-1/2).  We aimed to extend these relations to
ages much larger than those determined by studies of dMs in open
clusters (see Reid et al. 1995, Hawley et al. 1996, and references
therein).
