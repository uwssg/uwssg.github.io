<h1>Observations </h1>
<p>

The official 40 night NOAO approved survey began in 2005. Observing
was scheduled in six night groups during bright time: 2005 September
16-21, 2006 March 14-19, 2006 May 11-16, 2006 October 5-10, 2007 March
29 to 2007 April 3, and 2007 May 26 to 2007 June 1. All observations
were done on the KPNO 4-meter Mayall telescope using the Florida
Multi-object Imaging Near-IR grism Observational Spectrometer
(FLAMINGOS) instrument. The detector is a 2048x2048 HgCdTe wide-field
IR imager and multi-slit spectrometer with a pixel size of 0.3165"
which gives a 10.8x10.8' FOV on the 4 meter telescope. Conditions were
highly variable with about 40% of the time lost to weather, instrument
issues and longer overheads than expected. Total integration times of
50 minutes (dithered) gives 5\sigma limit of K ~ 20.0.

<h3> Data Reduction and Calibration </h3>

Data were processed using standard NOAO IRAF routines. A set of dark
frames were taken and subtracted from each image. A set of 6-10
adjacent (in time) images were combined to create a sky flat for
division (i.e. running sky flats). The images were approximately
aligned based on the dither offsets, then the IRAF tasks mscgetcat and
msccmatch were used to accurately register the images for
coaddition. The IRAF task msccmatch uses a catalog of stars from the 2
Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Our final astrometry is accurate to
subarcsecond precision, with the residual difference between the
K-band and SDSS positions well fit by a Gaussian of width
0.25". Example sources with the K-band image overlayed by with
contours from the FIRST radio data are shown in Figure 1.

Each FLAMINGOS field was processed with SExtractor version
2.3.2. Quoted K-band mag- nitudes are SExtractor MAG AUTO unless
otherwise noted. Due to the large field of view of the FLAMINGOS
instrument, a large number (~50) of bright sources detected in 2MASS
are present in each field. Using a custom webservice interface to the
GESTALT webservice <a
href="http://nvogre.astro.washington.edu:8080/gestalt_home/"> WESIX
</a> sources were cross matched with point sources from the 2MASS
catalog having Ks < 15.3, the 5\sigma limiting magnitude for point
sources. Saturated stars were excluded from the comparison. A linear
least squares fit between the SExtractor and 2MASS objects was
performed to determine the slope and zero point offset between the two
datasets. This solution was assumed to continue linearly beyond the Ks
= 15.3 limit. An example of this calibration is shown in Figure
1. </p>
