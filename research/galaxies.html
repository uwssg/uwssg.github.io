<h3> Classification of Spectra</h3>

<p>
Through a Principal Component Analysis of 400,000 galaxy and 50,000
QSO spectra (Yip et al 2004a, 2004b) we have shown that we can
describe the spectral properties of galaxies and QSOs with a small
number of orthogonal components. This represents a reduction in data
size by a factor of nearly 400 over the complete spectra. The
coefficients of the first three eigencomponents correlate with
physical properties of the galaxies such as star-formation rate, and
post star-burst activity. PCA does not, however, perform well when
reconstructing high-frequency structure within a spectrum (i.e. the
distribution of emission lines, lines-ratios, and line-widths). High
frequency, or local, features do not contribute significantly to the
total variance and are, therefore, not represented in the primary
eigencomponents. Other dimensionality reduction techniques such as
Local Linear Embedding (Roweis and Saul 2000) can over come these
issues providing (vanderPlas and Connolly 2009) a simple and automated
classification.

Understanding the evolution of the Type Ia supernova rate is essential
to our understanding of the star formation history of the
Universe. Lately, high redshift measurements of the Type Ia rate have
been receiving a lot of publicity, but understanding supernovae in the
local universe is also important. In particular, comparison of
detection methods and the associated rate measurements at low redshift
can improve methods at higher redshift. Using a novel approach for
detecting Type Ia supernovae in single epoch spectroscopic
observations we identify 100+ SN within the SDSS survey data.  This
results in a luminosity weighted rate of 0.24 SNu at z=0.1. Our
measurement is in good agreement with others at low redshift but is
one of the largest local samples todate.

<h3>Resolving Star Formation and Mass</h3>

<p>
Given a multi-color image of the sky or even just multi-color cutouts
around individual galaxies the resolved nature of these images
provides a unique opportunity to study the physical processes that
drive the formation and evolution of galaxies within our
universe. Previous work has shown that the environment in which
agalaxy resides can significantly affect the star formation
activitywithin the galaxy itself (Gomez et al 2003, Lewis etal 2002,
Hogg etal 2003}. For galaxies in overdense regions the star formation
appears to be more centrally condensed than for field galaxies.  A
number of mechanisms for causing this circumnuclear activity (as
opposed to the more general star formation in HII regions within the
disks of galaxies) have been suggested. These include tidal stripping
of the gas from the outskirts of a galaxy as it impacts the
intracluster medium, merging of galaxy sub-components and galaxy
harassment.  We can address these questions by decomposing the
internal photometric structure of galaxies into basic constituents
such as the age of the stellar population, their metallicities and
their dust content by fitting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to
the observed fluxes(see Figure 2 for an example of this).

<h3>Classifying and Monitoring Active Galactic Nuclei</h3>

<p>
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are important actors in the cosmic history of black hole growth, galaxy evolution (e.g., Di Matteo et al., 2005; Hopkins et al., 2007), galaxy clusters (e.g., Begelman, 2004), and even the ionization level of the universe (e.g., Loeb & Barkana, 2001).  AGN are highly luminous across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, with each emission regime (radio, infrared, optical, UV, X-rays, gamma rays) revealing important information about a particular component of AGN emission.  Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to collect large, multi-wavelength AGN samples that are representative of the full AGN population.  Each observing mission has its own characteristics, and deep observations are only available in narrow "pencil beams" at many wavelengths.  As an example of current research, we have recently analyzed relations between X-ray and optical/UV accretion disk emission to see whether coronae are ubiquitous components of black hole accretion (Gibson et al. 2008b).  We have also fit about 80,000 SDSS quasar spectra to identify and characterize over 5000 quasars exhibiting broad absorption lines (BALs) from powerful outflows (Gibson et al. 2009a,b).  These outflows are likely to be a structural or evolutionary phenomenon common to AGN, and may be an important means by which AGN affect their surroundings.  Long-term monitoring of the evolution of quasar spectra may also reveal the structure and origin of BAL outflows (e.g., Gibson et al. 2008a, 2009c).
