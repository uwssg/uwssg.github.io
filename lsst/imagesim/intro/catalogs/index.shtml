<h4> Galaxy Catalogs </h4>

In order to reproduce the spatial, morphological, and spectral energy
distributions of galaxies that are targetted by LSST, we currently use
the Millennium Simulation galaxy catalog as a starting point. The
models presented in Kitzbichler & White (2007) introduce baryon
physics into the Millennium Simulation that reproduce the color,
luminosity, and clustering distribution observed in large and deep
surveys. The baryonic physics in the Kitzbichler & White (2007) models
include gas cooling, heating from star formation, supernovae, and
'radio mode' feedback. A model for the ISM dust produces a good match
with the color-luminosity relation seen in deep surveys. The models of
the Millennium Simulation follow galaxies in a box that is 500 Mpc
h<sup>-1</sup>, on a side, simulating a light-cone survey with an area
of 11.5 x 2.3-deg<sup>2</sup> out to a redshift of z=1 that has no
repeating objects. To reproduce the LSST sky coverage the resulting
2x2 deg galaxy catalogs from Kitzbichler & White are tiled across the
sky.

To meet LSST photometric science goals, a detailed modeling of the
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for all source is required.  The
SED of each galaxy is estimated using the Bruzual & Charlot (2003)
stellar population models.  The Kitzbichler & White (2007) models
provide SDSS g, r, i, z-band magnitudes, Johnson Filter K-band
magnitudes, and redshift for every galaxy, which enables the Bruzual &
Charlot (2003) model spectra to be fit to all galaxies in a
post-processing step.  With the appropriate SED and redshift, the LSST
apparent magnitudes are calculated for all sources.  This enables a
characterization of each simulated galaxy's star formation history.
Using the models of Batissta et al (2006) each galaxy in the
Millennium Simulation is assigned a morphological profile.  The
current implementation assigns each galaxy a disk-to-total flux ratio,
position angle in the sky, inclination along the line-of-sight, bulge
radius, and disk radius.  More accurate galaxy profiles, including
high-frequency spatial structure such as HII regions and Spiral Arms,
can be simulated using FITS images as input into the simulator.

<h4> Stellar Catalogs </h4>

Stars are included in the Image Simulator with full SEDs, spatial
velocities, and positions.  Selecting stellar populations with a wide
range in spatial distribution and velocity parameters will demonstrate
LSST's science-goal of mapping the Milky Way's structure.  The SEDs
for stars are derived from Kurucz models. The model used to generate
main sequence stars is based on work done by Juric et. al. The model
includes user-specified amounts of thick-disk, thin-disk, and halo
stars. Each version of a catalog contains metadata on metallicity,
temperature, luminosity-type, and surface gravity, allowing the user
to search for correlations between observed LSST photometry and
physical information about stars using the simulated data. The catalog
will be updated to include dwarf and giant stars.

<h4> Catalog Query Tool </h4>

As the LSST is designed to study all ranges of astronomical phenomena,
a detailed catalog of the properties of objects has been
developed. Associated with the is a Query Tool that enables, for
example, a user to have a list of object parameters returned from a
query of the catalog after giving the sky coordinates and observation
Epoch.  The LSST input catalog includes stars, galaxies, solar system
objects, and transients.  The existence of a wide range of variable
phenomena in the sky require the catalog, and query tool, to keep
track of observing epoch that sources have been observed.  With such a
wide range of light curves, a single light curve cannot be adopted,
and instead a light-curve interpolator has been developed. This light
curve interpolator does not restrict LSST to a particular type of
transient object, but allows any variable object to be included in the
LSST framework by specifying the brightness as a function of time.
These variable objects currently included supernoave, active stars,
AGN, and solar system objects.  Active Galactic Nuclei are included in
the simulator as point source on top of galaxy profiles, with a
specific parameters for the light curve simulator.
