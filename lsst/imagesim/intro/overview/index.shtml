<h4> LSST Image Simulation </h4>

The image simulation group provides high fidelity end-to-end
simulations of the sky. These simulated images and catalogs extend to
r=28 (deeper than the expected 10 year depth of the LSST coadded
images) and are used in: designing and testing algorithms for the use
by the data management groups, evaluating the capabilities and
scalability of the reduction and analysis pipelines, testing and
optimizing the scienctific returns of the LSST survey and providing
realistic LSST data to the science collaborations to evaluate the
expected performance of LSST.

Figure 1: The data flow from catalogs to images for the LSST
</center>
<p>

Figure 1 shows the flow of the data through the LSST simulation
framework. Catalogs from cosmological and Galactic structure models
(<bf> base catalogs </bf>) are stored with a database enabling the
generation of a view of the sky above the atmosphere. These base
catalogs are derived from different simulation groups and include the
spectral, photometric, astrometric and morphological properties of the
astronomical sources. This static view of the sky has been extended to
include transient events and moving sources (e.g. supernovae, variable
stars and AGN, proper motions and Solar System objects).
<p>

The base catalogs are queried based on simulated observation sequences
from the operational simulator (<a
href="http://opsimcvs.tuc.noao.edu/" >OpSim </a>) creating a series of
<bf> instance catalogs </br>. The time together with the RA and Dec of
each pointing enable the appropriate airmass, sky background and
observing conditions to be propagated through the simulations (as well
as incorporating variability and moving sources). At this point, the
catalogs are output, with associated uncertainties, as LSST simulated
catalogs and are reformatted for input into the image simulator.
<p>

The image simulator samples from the sources within the catalogs
(including the morphological and spectral information). Each photon is
traced photons through a multi-layer the atmosphere, through the
telescope optics and detector. For each focal plane we simulate
10<sup>11</sup> photons (not including sky photons) to produce a total
of 189 4096x4096 CCD images. The images are formatted as standard FITS
files (with appropriate World Coordinate Systems) for access by
scientists and for input into the LSST data reduction systems.
