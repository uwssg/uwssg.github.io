<h4> Simulating Focal Plane </h4>

The focal plane of the LSST will be tiled with 189 4Kx4K CCDs, whose
worst case heights will vary less than 10 &mu m (peak-to-valley) but
in a complicated way relative to the nominal flat surface. Although
this flatness deviation is small compared with other cameras, the
small f-ratio of the LSST optics makes this focal plane flatness
variation play a critical role in aberration-induced PSF
elongation. Through the image simulation group we can simulate the
impact of the resulting PSF on LSST science.<p>

Figure 1 shows the distribution of Chip heights for the 189 CCDs in
the focal plane (we assume worst case height variations of 10 &mu m, tilts of
2.5x10<sup>-4</sup> radians and a "potato chip" surface variation of 5
&mu m). From this we simulate the variation in the PSF elipticity as a
function of postion on the focal plane. <a href="#fig2"> Figure 2 </a>
shows the resulting ellipticities superimposed on the focal pane
(after accounting for the atmosphere, telescope and CCD height and
shape variations). As expected, we observe sharp discontinuities in
PSF pattern across chip gaps, where abrupt changes in focus can
happen. The overall shape of the variations is, however, stable and can be
modelled with a spatially variable PSF.

Using a chip-by-chip PSF interpolation with basis functions derived
from a Principal Component Analysis <a href="#fig3"> Figure 3 </a>, we
can model and the spatial variation in the PSF and also the
discontinuities from chip-to-chip. Removing these discontinuities (see
the right panel of <a href="#fig2"> Figure 2 </a>) results in
residuals in the ellipticites and galaxy shear errors that are well
below that required for precision weak lensing for the LSST survey. (
~0.01% in the PSF ellipticity measurements). Our image simulation
shows that this remarkable accuracy in the PSF modelling allows us to
keep the background noise in the two-point shear measurement at
~10<sup>-6</sup> or below in a single 10 sq. deg field. We expect that
this noise floor will decrease linearly with the survey area until we
reach the hard limit set by the PSF correction accuracy. A full-scale
20,000 sq. degree simulation is on-going, and a more robust
PSF-correction (apart from PSF modelling) algorithm is under
development. Details of this analysis can be found <a
