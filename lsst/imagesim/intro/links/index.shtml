The LSST is developing a range of tools to help scientists to
understand the expect characteristics of the LSST. These range from
simulating images based on ray tracing photons, to simulations of the
expected cadence of the surveys to provide estimates of the depth of
the LSST as a function of time, to simulations of the expected
signal-to-noise of a given source based on the LSST exposure times. We provide links to these ongoing programs <p>
<p> 

<a href="http://www.lsst.org/"> LSST </a> the main site for LSST
information which provides links to the the science goals, survey
characteristics and news about the development of the LSST.
<p>

<a href="http://opsimcvs.tuc.noao.edu/"> Operational Simulator </a>
which simulates the cadence of the LSST observations and how well
these etendues can meet the survey requirements. The simulator
includes models for weather and local seeing based on actual site
measurements, lunar cycle and the telescopes dynamic characteristics.
<p>

<a href="http://dls.physics.ucdavis.edu/etc"> Exposure Time Calculator
</a> which simulates the expected depths and signal-to-noise based on
the sensitivities, sky brightness and source characteristics.
