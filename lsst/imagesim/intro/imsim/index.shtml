<h4> Introduction </h4>


The organization of the image simulator is based on a Monte Carlo
history of each photon emitted by sources such as galaxies or stars.
The <a href="../catalogs" >input to the simulator</a> is a model of
the sky composed of galaxies and stars with their associated spectral
energy distributions in the form of images with a fine spatial
resolution much better than the LSST resolution. Multiple versions of
the models can be simultaneously realized as a series of photons with
precise sky locations and wavelengths. The final synthetic sky can be
as simple as a grid of stars or as complex as a series of shells in z
that comprise a 3D cosmological model composed of nearby stars,
galaxies at intermediate z associated with dark matter and distant
galaxies at high z that are distorted by the gravitational lensing of
the emitted photons as they pass through dark matter at intermediate
z. This versatility supports simulations of many types ranging from
evaluation of PSF effects of the atmosphere on the images of stars and
galaxies to the simulation and full analysis of a particular
cosmological model. Also space-based images with fine angular
resolution can be used directly as input sky models. The concept
end-to-end refers to the history of the photons.  The following list
is the steps of the simulator:

<ul> <li> Photons are selected from a sky model using images and
spectral energy distributions </li>

<li>A set of atmosphere screens based on turbulence models are used to
refract the photons</li>

<li>Each photon is traced through the complete set of LSST optics</li>

<li>The photons interact and are converted in a detector simulator and
are readout</li> </ul>

The wavelength dependence of the photons is modeled at all stages of
the simulation process. The fidelity of the current version of the
simulator is designed to include all details that affect science
performance with an emphasis on astrometry, photometry. Future
versions will include details to support other science topics and
secondary effects on weak lensing.

<h4> The Atmosphere </h4>

The atmosphere is modeled by a series of layers each with an
independent 3D Kolmogorov model that is averaged into an equivalent
screen with refractive index variations in 2D <a href="#fig1" >(Figure
1)</a>. Each layer has an outer scale, a random realization of
gaussian amplitude phase independent Fourier modes with a seeing for
each layer set by the Fried parameter R0.  The time dependence of the
atmospheric seeing is modeled by the frozen translating screen
approximation with a wind velocity and direction. The single photon
history is traced through each layer of the atmosphere via a newly
invented technique that avoids the need to do Fourier transforms of
the wavefront perturbations.  The approach is only valid for large
aperture telescopes with exposure times of at least 10-20 seconds. A
practical weak lensing simulation requires this approach since each
photon from a faint galaxy (only 1000s) in a single integration (15
seconds) occurs at a different time within the exposure window for
which the atmospheric structure has changed significantly. We can
avoid Fourier transforms because the diffraction effects are averaged
over a modest exposure (15 seconds) and over a large aperture (8
m). The figure below shows an example of a single Kolmogorov phase
screen that spans a region of the atmosphere much larger than the
aperture of the telescope.  This allows for wind drifts during the
exposure and for full wide field (3.5 degree diameter) images.<p>

<h4> The Telescope </h4>

A geometric raytrace code for the LSST designed optics has been
developed.  The raytrace handles reflection/refraction after
calculating ray intercepts.  The full wavelength-dependent refraction
and filter transmission effects as well as stray light are included.
<a href="#fig2" >Figure 2</a> shows the current LSST design and shows
rays being reflected and refracted through the optics: the three
mirrors, three lenses, the filter, and detector.  On the surfaces of
all the mirrors we currently apply a set of perturbations consisting
of a set of orthogonal functions with a power spectrum resembling
realistic perturbations found with the Kitt Peak 4m telescope when the
active optics control system was operating.  This model is designed to
mimic the surface perturbations expected from thermal and mechanical
distortions while a modern control system is being used.<p>

<h4> The Detector </h4>

The current detector model built into the simulator treats conversion
of individual photons into charge carriers collected at the
channel. Each ray is refracted into the silicon according to its
wavelength and incidence angle. The photon either interacts or doesn't
interact, depending on its absorption range (dependent on wavelength
and temperature of the silicon). The charge diffuses laterally during
the time it takes to drift to the channel. The amount of diffusion is
dictated by the strength of the electric field at the point of
interaction.  The resulting PSF has limiting behavior in the two
extremes of the instrument's band. The short wavelength achromaticity
is broadened further by shallow interaction distribution in the CCD
(contributing &sigma =4 &mu m in each lateral dimension). On the long
wavelength end, the PSF is dominated by the beam's refraction through
the thick (100 &mu m) silicon, combined with the large interaction
length. <a href="#fig3" > Figure 3</a> shows a simulation of a field
for the LSST with and without sky background. Every photon was
raytraced using complete wavelength-dependent effects through 12
layers of atmospheric turbulence, the complete LSST designed optics,
and the detector. Stars and galaxies were simulated down to r=28 and
sky noise background was added (including the impact of the moon on
the sky background).  The end-to-end simulation of a complete focal
plane takes approximately 2000 CPU hours.  Approximately
10<sup>8</sup> photons were simulated. <p>

<h4> Modelling Image Distortions </h4>

The ellipticity of the point spread function (PSF) of any ground based
telescope depends both on the properties of the atmosphere and the
design and operation of the telescope and detector.  Understanding the
ellipticity of the PSF and its correlation across the field is
critical to the success of the LSST (e.g. for weak lensing
measurements).  Our simulations demonstrate that the ellipticity may
receive similar contributions from the optics and the atmosphere (1 to
2% for each), which is similar to the shear from a massive foreground
cluster of galaxies.  The optics contribution to the ellipticity of
the PSF, however, is highly correlated on several hundred arcsecond
scales.  This is due to the fact that the secondary and tertiary
mirrors in the LSST optics chain are relatively close to the pupil
plane.  Photons emitted from all points in the field of view see a
similar part of the surfaces of all the mirrors.  Every perturbation,
therefore, affects the PSF across the field of view in a similar way.
While it is important to control the overall ellipticity induced by
the optics in the design of LSST, it is anticipated from these
simulations that the optics contribution the ellipticity of the PSF
will be easily correctable, since it is highly correlated.  Studies
are continuing to identify other instrumental problems that could
affect weak lensing measurements. <a href="#fig4" > Figure 4</a>
demonstrates the expected PSF function when we turn on various parts
of the simulator.  The upper left image shows the PSF due to the
optics alone with the mirror perturbations.  The second image shows
the PSF after the detector simulator is included.  The lower left
image shows the PSF when the atmosphere with no wind is included.  The
lower right shows the same but with wind.  Clearly, the effect of wind
reduces the ellipticity due to a larger part of the atmospheric
turbulence that is being averaged.<p>
