<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>What is the LSST?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
The LSST, or the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, is a facility that will produce a 6-band (0.3-1.1
micron) wide-field deep astronomical survey of over 20,000 square degrees of the
southern sky using an 8.4-meter ground-based telescope.
Each patch of sky will be visited about 1000 times in ten years.
The LSST leverages innovative technology in all subsystems:
the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/camera">camera</a>
(3200 Megapixels, which will be the world's largest digital camera),

<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/telescope">telescope</a>
(simultaneous casting of the primary and tertiary
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/mirror-casting">mirrors</a>;
two aspheric optical surfaces on one substrate), a 9.6 square degree field of
view with excellent image quality, and
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/data">data management</a>
(30 terabytes of data nightly, nearly instant alerts
issued for objects that change in position or brightness).
This innovation on all fronts has attracted many
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/about/team">institutional
members</a> and hundreds of other scientists in ten 
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/participate">science
collaborations.</a>
Click <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/overview"> here </a> 

for a description of the LSST system and science reach, written for the
scientific community.
</p>

<HR id="q2" class="dec">
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>What will the survey coverage be?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
LSST will repeatedly scan the sky south of +10 deg DEC accumulating 1000 pairs
of 15 second exposures through ugrizy filters, yielding a dataset that simultaneously
satisfies the majority of the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/science/science_portfolio">
science goals</a>. This concept, the so-called "universal cadence", will
yield the main 20,000 square degree deep-wide-fast
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/science/participate">
survey</a> (typical single visit depth of r ~24.5)
and use about 90% of the observing time. The remaining 10% of the time 
will be used to obtain improved coverage of parameter space such as 
ultra deep frequent observations, observations with very short revisit 
times (~1 minute), and observations of "special" regions such as the 
Ecliptic, Galactic plane, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. 
For example, fifty selected 10 square degree "deep drilling" fields could be
covered with 40 hour-long sequences of 200 exposures each. Each 
exposure in a sequence would have an equivalent 5-sigma depth of
r~24, and each filter subsequence when coadded would be 2 magnitudes 
deeper than the main survey visits (r~26.5). When all 40 sequences and 
the main survey visits are coadded, they would extend the depth to r~28 AB mag. 

</p>

<HR id="q3" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>What does "Synoptic" mean?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
Our use of the word derives from the Greek word "Synopsis" and refers to
looking at all aspects of something. In astronomy it often means looking at
phenomena over time.
The LSST is a synoptic survey in several ways: billions of objects will
be imaged in six colors in an unprecedented large volume of our universe
out beyond redshift 3 for galaxies. Several billion galaxies and ten billion
stars will be cataloged.
This survey over half the sky will also catalog changes in the intensity or
color of these
sources over a wide window from tens of seconds to years. Alerts will be
produced
within one minute of the event. </p>

<HR id="q4" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>Why do we need the LSST?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 

Until recently, most astronomical investigations have focused on small samples 
of cosmic sources or individual objects. This is because our largest telescope 
facilities typically had rather small fields of view, and those with large
fields of view could not detect very faint sources. With all of our existing 
telescope facilities, we have still surveyed only a minute volume of the 
observable Universe. 
Over the past two decades, however, advances in technology have made it possible
to move beyond the traditional observational paradigm and to undertake large-scale 
sky surveys. From its mountaintop <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/site">site</a>
in Chile, the LSST will image the entire visible sky every few nights,
thus capturing changes and opening up the time-domain window over an
unprecedented
range of timescales for billions of faint objects. 
Each sky patch will be visited 1000 times during the survey with a pair of
exposures per visit. 
The LSST data will enable 
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/science_goals">qualitatively new
science</a>.
Billions of objects in our universe will be seen for the first time and
monitored over time.
Motivated by the evident scientific progress enabled by large sky surveys,
multiple <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/reports">national reports</a> have
concluded that a dedicated ground-based wide-field imaging telescope with an
effective aperture 
of 6-8 meters is a high priority for astronomy, physics, and planetary science 
over the next decade. 
With a thousand-fold increase in survey power in time-volume space over 
current facilities, LSST is likely to make unexpected discoveries. 
</p>

<HR id="q5" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG> 
Where does LSST rank among the many proposed national scientific facilities?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 

Over the past decade six <a href="http://lsst.org/lsst/science/reports">national reports</a>
have ranked LSST as a high priority.
This is because LSST is uniquely capable of attacking some of the greatest
mysteries
in astronomy and physics.
National committees studying options for the next generation facility
have recommended LSST for its capability to study many fundamental questions
in astronomy and physics all at the same time. Rather than building separate
facilities to study near&#151;Earth asteroids, or the outer solar system,
or how our galaxy was formed, or the nature of energetic explosions in the
universe, or the mysterious dark matter and dark energy, LSST has a sufficient
light grasp (throughput) to undertake all these scientific programs
simultaneously
from the same Wide&#151;Fast&#151;Deep survey. 
</p>


<HR id="q6" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
Why did you choose to build the telescope in Chile?
</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 

The decision to place LSST on Cerro Pachon in Chile was made by an
international site selection committee based on a competitive process that is
<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/site_selection">described here</a>.
In short, modern telescopes are located in sparsely populated places (to avoid
light pollution), at high altitudes and in dry climates (to avoid cloud cover).
In addition to those physical concerns there are infrastructure issues such as
existing facilities, bandwidth cost, and technical personnel. The
best ten candidate sites in both hemispheres wordwide were studied by the site
selection committee. Site image quality at Cerro Pachon is competitive with the
best world-wide. 
Cerro Pachon was the overall winner in terms of quality
of the site for astronomical imaging and available infrastructure. The result
will be superb deep images from the ultraviolet to near infrared over the
vast panorama of the entire southern sky.
</p>

<HR id="q7" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>What is the LSST schedule and cost?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
The LSST is scheduled for first engineering light in 2014 and for early science
operations beginning in 2015. Full science operations will begin in 2016.
[Calendar years] The LSST project will cost $390M through first light,
including all construction, hardware, software, data management, and a 30%
contingency. [2006 $] This work-based cost estimate has remained constant
within 15% since the beginning of the project phase in 2003. 
Significant milestones have already been reached, including
the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/mirror-casting">casting</a> of
the <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/gallery/camera/optical_design_drawing">primary/tertiary</a>

<a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/science/highfire">mirror</a>. The LSST survey
will last for ten years.
</p>


<HR id="q8" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>Who is involved with LSST?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A:</STRONG> 
Click <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/about/team">here</a> to
meet the team and see a list of current institutional members. Over 100
engineers and scientists are working on the LSST system.
Many scientists are looking forward to LSST data. Some are already at work
planning their research and interfacing with the LSST project scientists and engineers.
Click <a href="http://www.lsst.org/lsst/about/team#science_collaborations">here</a> to
see a list of the ten Science Collaborations. Over 250 scientists are involved
in the LSST Science Collaborations currently, and the number is growing.
Using the SDSS experience as a guide, it is expected that ultimately there will
be thousands of papers published based on LSST data with over 5000 distinct
authors.

</p>

<HR id="q9" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>Why build an entirely new telescope for this task?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
Because no existing telescope can do what the LSST will do.
The LSST is different from other ground-based telescopes in that it is a large
aperture wide-field
survey telescope and camera that can move quickly around the sky tiling the sky
with 15 second exposures: Wide-Fast-Deep. That combination is unique: wide field
of view (10 square degrees), short exposures (pairs of 15-second exposures), and
sensitive camera (24th magnitude single images, 27th magnitude stacked). LSST is
far
more than a telescope. With its 3200 Megapixel camera, supercomputer, and giant
data
processing, analysis, and distribution system, the LSST facility will produce an
entirely new view of our universe enabling unforeseen explorations of discovery.
When using telescope-camera combinations with smaller
throughput, one must undertake different types of surveys in series. LSST will
cross a 
threshold where a single deep-wide-fast survey produces data for a wide range of
studies.

</p>

<HR id="q10" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"> <STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
Why an 8.4 meter mirror with a 3.5 degree field? Couldn't a smaller
telescope or an array of smaller telescopes do the same science in a
somewhat longer time?</p>

<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
Some of the science can't be done at all with a smaller telescope, or group of
small telescopes. For instance, the near-Earth object (NEO) survey is looking for
things that won't sit still for a long exposure. An exposure longer than 10 or 20 seconds
becomes ineffective, and so finding the vast majority of NEOs which are small and faint
requires a telescope that can collect a lot of light in 10 or 20 seconds. Similarly,
longer exposures on a smaller telescope will not help characterize faint transient
objects lasting only seconds. In an array of smaller telescopes, longer exposures would
be required (to reach the sky-noise limit) as well as multiple Gigapixel cameras.
<br>
Some of the science can be done on a smaller telescope in a longer time, but
consider the numbers: The speed with which you can survey an area of sky for objects of a
given faintness is proportional to throughput (collecting area times field of view in
meters squared degrees squared). The LSST enables totally new windows on the universe
because it has such a high throughput, or "etendue." The etendue of LSST is 320 square
meters square degrees. A primary mirror diameter of 8.4 m (effective aperture 6.7 m due 
to obscuration) is the minimum diameter that simultaneously satisfies the depth 
(24.5 mag depth per single visit and 27.5 mag for coadded depth) and cadence (revisit time 
of 3-4 days, with 30 seconds per visit) constraints. Above a throughput or "etendue" of 
200-300 square meters square degrees, many different surveys can be done using the same 
wide-fast-deep survey data -- a large multiplex advantage.
</p>

<HR id="q11" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>Why not a space mission?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
There are several reasons why the science mission of LSST is most cost-effective
with a ground facility. To probe the physics of dark energy, hemisphere coverage of the sky is necessary, as well as deep coverage. Some deep probes of the universe would benefit from the higher
angular resolution available in space. But they also require huge samples of
objects over a wide area of sky (large volume of the universe.) This Wide&#151;Deep
capability is hard to obtain in space. Another reason is surveying for fast events --
LSST will open this new window on the universe.
In any realistic space mission the Wide-Fast-Deep capability would be lost:
space telescopes have small collecting area compared to what can be built on the
ground, leading to long exposures and loss of timing information. Since all LSST's
science goals can be achieved from the ground, we must weigh the incremental benefit
against the drawbacks. The science that drives the need for the LSST requires ultra deep
and rapid wide&#151;field imaging at optical wavelengths&#151;a mission best
achieved on the ground at a superb site. </p>

<HR id="q12" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
What are the technology challenges and scale of effort?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
The realization of the LSST involves extraordinary engineering and 
technological challenges: the fabrication of large, high-precision aspheric
optics; construction of a huge, highly-integrated array of sensitive, wide-band 
imaging sensors; and the operation of a data management facility 
handling tens of terabytes of data each day. The design and development 
effort includes structural, thermal, and optical analyses 
of all key hardware subsystems, vendor interactions to determine 
manufacturability, explicit prototyping of high-risk elements, prototyping 
and development of data management systems, and extensive systems engineering 
studies. To validate system performance, full end-to-end simulations are being
done. Over 100 technical personnel at a range of institutions are currently 
engaged in this program. 
</p>

<HR id="q13" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>How does LSST probe the physics of dark energy?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A:</STRONG> 

Current observations suggest that most of the energy density of the universe is
in some unknown form. Dark energy affects the cosmic history 
of both the Hubble expansion and mass clustering. If combined, different types
of probes of the expansion history and structure history can lead to tight
constraints dark energy equation of state and other cosmological parameters. These tight
constraints arise because each technique depends on the cosmological parameters or errors in
different ways. A unique aspect of LSST as a probe of dark energy and matter is the use
of multiple cross-checking probes that reach unprecedented precision. 
These probes include weak gravitational lens (WL) cosmic shear, baryon 
acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae, and cluster counting -- all as a
function of 
redshift. Using the cosmic microwave background as normalization, the
combination 
of these probes can yield the needed precision to distinguish between models of
dark 
energy. In addition, time-resolved strong galaxy and cluster 
lensing probes the physics of dark matter. <br>
LSST data could lead to a hundred- to thousand-fold increase in precision over
precursor experiments about to be undertaken.
The power and accuracy of LSST dark energy and dark matter probes is derived 
from samples of several billion galaxies and tens of millions of Type-I
supernovae. The nominal high-SNR sample defined by i<25 mag (SNR>25 for point
sources) will include four billion galaxies (55 per suare arcminute) with the
mean 
photometric redshift accuracy of 1-2% (relative error for 1+z), and with 
only 10% of the sample with errors larger than 4%. The median redshift for 
this sample will be z=1.2, with the third quartile at z=2. For a 
subsample of 2 billion galaxies further constrained by flux limits in the 
g and z bands, the photometric redshift errors will be two to three times 
smaller. By simultaneously measuring mass growth (via weak lensing and cluster
counting) and curvature (via BAO and SN), LSST data will tell us whether the recent cosmic
acceleration is due to dark energy or modified gravity. 
</p>

<HR id="q14" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
Why do you need such accurate measurements of the shear power spectrum?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
Outside of the huge and rare mass overdensities of rich clusters of galaxies,
the mass contrast is much lower, giving rise to shear values below one
percent. Here, in the vast volume between the rich clusters, is where most of the dark
matter and dark energy of the universe exists. Current observations
suggest that most of the energy density of the universe is in some unknown
form. Weak gravitational lens "cosmic shear" as a function of distance
will measure both the geometry of the
universe and the growth rate of structure&#151;two related probes of the
equation of state of this dark energy. It is necessary to measure the weak
gravitational lens induced shear of billions of galaxies over a large area
and control systematic shear errors at the 0.0001 level.
</p>

<HR id="q15" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
Will it be possible to subscribe to real time alerts of LSST discoveries? </p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
Yes. Web alert pages and auto email alert services enabled by our data centers
via the Virtual Observatory will permit users to custom filter alerts based on
a number of classification parameters. About 2 billion objects 
will be routinely monitored for photometric and astrometric changes, and any 
transient events will be posted in less than 60 seconds 
(with a goal of 30 seconds) via web portals including the Virtual Observatory. 
</p>

<HR id="q16" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG> Will the full resolution, 
full depth image data be available to download? </p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 

Yes. There will be a range of data products and download portals. 
The LSST data system is being designed to enable as wide a range of science as 
possible. Standard data products, including calibrated images and catalogs of
detected objects and their attributes, will be provided both for individual 
exposures and the deep incremental data coaddition. 
For the "static" sky, there will be yearly database releases listing many 
attributes for billions of objects. This database will grow in size to about 
30 PB and about 20 billion objects. 
<br>
As in the SDSS, we expect a power law of user interactions with the data.
At one end of this distribution are simple lookup queries or color jpeg cutout
downloads.
At the other end are huge statistical calculations over the entire database, and
image 
operation scripts on billions of objects. The data management system is
budgeted to 
handle most but not all of that distribution. 
Institutions joining LSST early, and members of the LSST Science Collaborations,
will have the customary advantage of deep familiarity
with the LSST system and survey. 
</p>


<HR id="q17" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>
Will LSST imaging data be available world-wide for scientific use?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A:</STRONG> 
Our goal is open-source, open-data. 
Currently US federal agencies and foundations support LSST R&D, and the
LSST construction proposal is to a US agency.
However, we would like to make the LSST scientific data available world-wide.
To realize this goal, we are working with foreign institutions and
governments to share the costs. The ten LSST science collaborations
are open to all US scientists, and hopefully soon to an increasing number
of scientists in other countries. <br>
Our ultimate goal is world pubic data, but this will not be feasible without
early investment
by foreign consortia. US federal agencies will shoulder the brunt of the cost
of 
construction and the Data Management system is budgeted to serve the US
community.
Institutions joining LSST early will have the customary advantage of deep
familiarity
with the LSST system and survey. Early collaboration by institutions worldwide
will also 
assure access to additional local compuational capability to efficiently search
and run 
scripts on the 30PB database and undertake calculations on the 100PB of images.

</p>

<HR id="q18" class="dec"> 
<p class="q"><STRONG>Q: </STRONG>What are the data management challenges?</p>
<p class="a"><STRONG>A: </STRONG> 
The rapid cadence of the LSST observing program will produce about 30 TB per
night, leading to a total database over the ten years of operations of 60 PB for the
raw data, and 30 PB for the catalog database. 
The total data volume after processing will be several hundred PB, processed
using 100 TFlops of computing power. Processing 
such a large volume of data, converting the raw images into a faithful
representation of the universe, automated data quality assessment, and 
archiving the results in useful form for a broad community of users is a 
major challenge.
There will be both mountain summit and base computing 
facilities, as well as a central archive facility and multiple data access 
centers. The data will be sent over existing optical fiber 
links from South America to the U.S.
Although the data processing center will have substantial computing power (about
100 TFlops), current trends suggest that it will 
not even qualify for the top 500 list by the time of first light in 2014.
Hence, while LSST is making a novel use of advances in information technology, 
it is not taking the risk of pushing the expected technology to the limit.
