<h4> Data Formats </h4> <p>

Catalogs and images are generated for the Data Management group as
part of the DC3a data run. Samples of these data are available <a
href="/data/overview"> here</a>. The catalog data are formatted
separately for the stars and galaxies. The stellar catalogs are
provided as ascii files with columns <br>

<p>
object RA Dec r_magnitude  SED  index star <br>
<p>

The SED corresponds to the spectral energy distribution associated
with the source and are currently based on Kurucz models. The index
value is set to zero. The galaxy catalogs are formated with
columns<br>
<p>
"object" ra dec r_mag SED_file redshift "galaxy" bulge_to_total_ratio radius_disk (pixels) radius_bulge (pixels) postion_angle (radians) inclination (radians) <br>
<p>

For the galaxies the SEDs are derived from fits of the Millennium
galaxy colors to a series of Bruzual and Charlot models (with varying
star formation rates, dust and metallicities).
<p>


Images generated by the simulator are output in a standard FITS
format.  Each 65MB FITS file represents a single 4096x4096 CCD 15
second exposure with 0.2 arcsec pixels and covers 13.6x13.6 arcminutes
of the sky. Each FITS file contains keywords required by the LSST data
reduction pipelines including date, data sections, saturation level,
and world coordinate system (WCS). For the LSST pipelines we provide a
second set of these images broken into 16 amplifiers (512x2048) which
also include an overscan region and associated biases, darks and flat
field frames. <p>

The Image Simulation results predict non-linear distortions in the
coordinate system, at the sub-pixel level, across a CCD.  To meet the
LSST science-goal astrometric requirements (15 milliarcsec) and to
account for these non-linear optical distrotions, a TAN-SIP WCS
solution is implemented for these images.  TAN-SIP provides a
polynomial relation between CCD positions and the position on the sky
(where the order of the polynomial is user-specified).  TAN-SIP is
currently used by space-based missions such as Spitzer and by
Astrometry.net. The TAN-SIP convention is supported by the publically
available software package WCSTools and by Saoimage DS9.  By comparing
the known sky positions of stars to their positions detected in a
simulated image, we find that TAN-SIP can provide astrometric
solutions with an accuracy of 0.001-0.004 arc-seconds across a single
CCD.  Milli-arsecond astrometric accuracy will enable the astronomical
community to make trigonometric parallax measurements of a complete
sample of neighborhood stars out to a distance of 300 pc.
