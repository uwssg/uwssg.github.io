<h4> Initial Image Simulation Data </h4>
<p>

The directories linked below contain a series of test images. These
images were developed for the purpose of testing the Data Management
pipelines for data challenge DC3a. They are not intended to be
representative of the final LSST system but to enable the development
of analysis tools for working with the LSST data. The parameterization of
the images was designed to test the capabilities of the analysis
pipelines to a range of observing conditions. This includes varying
the PSF of the images from 0.4 to 1.8 arcseconds, changing the airmass
from 1.0 to 2.0, implementing two sky background mode with low (new
moon) and high (full moon and 20 degrees from the Moon) counts and
varying the mirror and optics specifications (including
aberrations). The images currently available represent 1% of the
completed data set and are available for evaluation. The file <a
href="dc3.txt">dc3.txt</a> lists the parameters used to define these
images including, seeing, airmass, position of CCD in the focal plane,
background sky. For access to the full simulation data contact <a
href="mailto:ajc@astro.washington.edu"> Andrew Connolly. </a> <p>


For the full data sample: Deep contains 96 images of the same field
(with varying seeing, airmass and backgrounds) for use in image
stacks, Ideal contains a simulation with no atmosphere, no optical
distortions, airmass of unity, 0.1 arcsec seeing and not sky
background (this defines an idealized view of the sky for use as a
truth table) and Wide contains 163 pointings which sample the focal
plane of the LSST telescope for a range of airmasses and seeing
values.  <br> <br>
